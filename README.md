Question: As a part-time job this semester, you are working for the Family Budget Assistance center. Your boss asks you to write a program that will analyze data for a family. Input for each family consists of:

- The family last name (string)
- Number of persons in the family (integer)
- Annual Income (double)
- Total debts (double)

Your program should interactively read these inputs (with appropriate prompt messages), perform calculations, then output the following:

1. An appropriate header
2. The family's last name, number of persons, income and debts
3. Predicted family living expenses ($3000 times the family size)
4. The monthly payments necessary to pay off the debt in one year
5. The amount the family should save (family size time 2% of the (income-debt))
